    <h2>Grand Army Plaza</h2>
	<p>Grand Army Plaza, the oval at the main entrance of Brooklyn’s Prospect Park, was meant to provide a wide and picturesque approach to the park, which park designer Calvert Vaux (1824–1895) considered a vital design element. The Plaza was one of the first features of Prospect Park to be built and marks the beginning of the Eastern Parkway (1866), the world’s first parkway, also designed by Vaux and his partner Frederick Law Olmsted (1822–1903). The parkway’s intended purpose was to connect the City’s parks with ornamental roads free of commercial traffic.

	<h2>Dr. Alexander J.C. Skene</h2>
	This impressive sculpture bust of Alexander Johnston Chalmers Skene, M.D. (1838-1900) honors a Brooklyn-based physician, medical researcher, college and hospital administrator whose lifetime of achievement had a broad impact on the medical profession. The statue is the work of the distinguished artist John Massey Rhind (1860-1936).

	<h2>Bailey Fountain</h2>
	Named after Brooklyn-based financier and philanthropist Frank Bailey (1865-1953) and his wife Mary Louise Bailey, this elaborate sculptural waterwork is one of several which have occupied a central place in Brooklyn’s Grand Army Plaza.

	<h2>General Gouverneur Kemble Warren</h2>
	This sculpture by Henry Baerer (1837–1908) honors the distinguished Union Army general Gouverneur Kemble Warren (1830–1882). It is one of three Civil War monuments that grace this oval plaza and entryway to Prospect Park, which was first laid out in the 1860s and dedicated in 1926 to the Grand Army of the Republic (the Union Army in the Civil War).

	<h2>John F. Kennedy Memorial</h2>
	This monument honors John Fitzgerald Kennedy (1917-1963), the thirty-fifth President of the United States.
